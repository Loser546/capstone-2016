#Website Ideas

This document is just a sounding board for any ideas you have with regard to the website. You don't need to know anything about web development to contribute, this is just a place that we can reference when we are talking about ideas in class.

Feel free to contribute to this.

The structure that I am using is simple. I'll have three sections:

The first section, called "Ideas" is just a dumping ground for ideas that I have. They may or may not be implemented

The second section, called "Intentions" is basically "I intend to actually work on this, but haven't started yet." Basically, if I've decided that I really want to add something, but am busy working on something else, I'll list it here. Feel free to work on the stuff in my (or others') Intentions section.

The third is the next logical step: Active Development. This is stuff that I am currently working on that isn't listed directly in the agenda.

You don't have to contribute like this if you don't want to. If you just want to dump a bunch of half-thought ideas or phrases, go for it. No judgment.

Ideas:

* Brochure page, with a sliding carousel of screenshots of the software and stock pictures of smiling doctors. We may not be business majors, but it doesn't hurt to show that we know how to market our software, at least to individual customers and/or higher-ups.

Intentions:

* A comprehensive section of the site for learning, including multiple resources for each topic.

Active Development:

* Navigation bar for resources regarding the various aspects of the project. Java, SQL, and HTML stuff. [Mostly done]
